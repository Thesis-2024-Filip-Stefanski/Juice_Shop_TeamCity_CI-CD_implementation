## Alert Detail



### [ Cloud Metadata Potentially Exposed ](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/90034/)



##### High (Low)

### Description

The Cloud Metadata Attack attempts to abuse a misconfigured NGINX server in order to access the instance metadata maintained by cloud service providers such as AWS, GCP and Azure.
All of these providers provide metadata via an internal unroutable IP address '169.254.169.254' - this can be exposed by incorrectly configured NGINX servers and accessed by using this IP address in the Host header field.

* URL: http://localhost:3000/latest/meta-data/%3FEIO=4&transport=polling&t=OrL4by4&sid=34iAG4GjvvSpWqWdAABw
  * Method: `POST`
  * Parameter: ``
  * Attack: `169.254.169.254`
  * Evidence: ``
  * Other Info: `Based on the successful response status code cloud metadata may have been returned in the response. Check the response data to see if any cloud metadata has been returned.
The meta data returned can include information that would allow an attacker to completely compromise the system.`

Instances: 1

### Solution

Do not trust any user data in NGINX configs. In this case it is probably the use of the $host variable which is set from the 'Host' header and can be controlled by an attacker.

### Solution

Do not trust client side input, even if there is client side validation in place.
In general, type check all data on the server side.
If the application uses JDBC, use PreparedStatement or CallableStatement, with parameters passed by '?'
If the application uses ASP, use ADO Command Objects with strong type checking and parameterized queries.
If database Stored Procedures can be used, use them.
Do *not* concatenate strings into queries in the stored procedure, or use 'exec', 'exec immediate', or equivalent functionality!
Do not create dynamic SQL queries using simple string concatenation.
Escape all data received from the client.
Apply an 'allow list' of allowed characters, or a 'deny list' of disallowed characters in user input.
Apply the principle of least privilege by using the least privileged database user possible.
In particular, avoid using the 'sa' or 'db-owner' database users. This does not eliminate SQL injection, but minimizes its impact.
Grant the minimum database access that is necessary for the application.

### [ Content Security Policy (CSP) Header Not Set ](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/10038/)



##### Medium (High)

### Description

Content Security Policy (CSP) is an added layer of security that helps to detect and mitigate certain types of attacks, including Cross Site Scripting (XSS) and data injection attacks. These attacks are used for everything from data theft to site defacement or distribution of malware. CSP provides a set of standard HTTP headers that allow website owners to declare approved sources of content that browsers should be allowed to load on that page â€” covered types are JavaScript, CSS, HTML frames, fonts, images and embeddable objects such as Java applets, ActiveX, audio and video files.

### Solution

Ensure that your web server, application server, load balancer, etc. is configured to set the Content-Security-Policy header.

Instances: 21

### Solution

Ensure that sensitive data is not available in an unauthenticated manner (using IP address white-listing, for instance).
Configure the "Access-Control-Allow-Origin" HTTP header to a more restrictive set of domains, or remove all CORS headers entirely, to allow the web browser to enforce the Same Origin Policy (SOP) in a more restrictive manner.

### Description

The Error Logging Modules and Handlers (ELMAH [elmah.axd]) HTTP Module was found to be available. This module can leak a significant amount of valuable information.

### Solution

Consider whether or not ELMAH is actually required in production, if it isn't then disable it. If it is then ensure access to it requires authentication and authorization. See also: https://elmah.github.io/a/securing-error-log-pages/

### Solution

Modern Web browsers support the Content-Security-Policy and X-Frame-Options HTTP headers. Ensure one of them is set on all web pages returned by your site/app.
If you expect the page to be framed only by pages on your server (e.g. it's part of a FRAMESET) then you'll want to use SAMEORIGIN, otherwise if you never expect the page to be framed, you should use DENY. Alternatively consider implementing Content Security Policy's "frame-ancestors" directive.

### [ Private IP Disclosure ](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/2/)



##### Low (Medium)

### Description

A private IP (such as 10.x.x.x, 172.x.x.x, 192.168.x.x) or an Amazon EC2 private hostname (for example, ip-10-0-56-78) has been found in the HTTP response body. This information might be helpful for further attacks targeting internal systems.

* URL: http://localhost:3000/rest/admin/application-configuration
  * Method: `GET`
  * Parameter: ``
  * Attack: ``
  * Evidence: `192.168.99.100:3000`
  * Other Info: `192.168.99.100:3000
192.168.99.100:4200
`

Instances: 1

### Solution

Remove the private IP address from the HTTP response body.  For comments, use JSP/ASP/PHP comment instead of HTML/JavaScript comment which can be seen by client browsers.

### [ X-Content-Type-Options Header Missing ](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/10021/)



##### Low (Medium)

### Description

The Anti-MIME-Sniffing header X-Content-Type-Options was not set to 'nosniff'. This allows older versions of Internet Explorer and Chrome to perform MIME-sniffing on the response body, potentially causing the response body to be interpreted and displayed as a content type other than the declared content type. Current (early 2014) and legacy versions of Firefox will use the declared content type (if one is set), rather than performing MIME-sniffing.

### Solution

Ensure that the application/web server sets the Content-Type header appropriately, and that it sets the X-Content-Type-Options header to 'nosniff' for all web pages.
If possible, ensure that the end user uses a standards-compliant and modern web browser that does not perform MIME-sniffing at all, or that can be directed by the web application/web server to not perform MIME-sniffing.
